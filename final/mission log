head to earth. build a rocketship
rocketship specifications:

        private data members
                name, string
                fuel, unsigned int

        public function interface

                setName,getName
                setFuel,getFuel
                
sucessfully arrived on saturn:

need to head to jupiter
rocketship upgrade specs:
new private data members
                vector<unsigned int> fuelCells
                -- each element of the vector represents a fuel cell --
                -- with a specific amount (unsigned int) of fuel --

        new public function interface
                void addFuelCell(unsigned int fuelAmount)
                -- add a new element to fuelCells to contain fuelAmount --

                string burnFuel(unsigned int cellNumber)
                -- zero out/burn all of the fuel in the specified cell (0-indexed) --
                -- returns a string of asterisks representing the fuel in the cell --

need to make inherited rocketship
update base rocketship first
 new public function interface
                overloaded constructor (string newName, unsigned int newFuel)

        convert private access modifier to protected
        -- Ask yourself, why would you need to do this? --

need to head to mars now

sucessfully arrived on mars

need to make an activator
activator specs:

                none

        public function interface
                unsigned int getPrime (unsigned int whichPrime)

                unsigned int sumTheDigits (unsigned int value)
                -- return the sum of the digits in a value --
                -- reduced to a single digit --
                -- ex: sum of digits in 99 is 9+9=18, 1+8=9, return 9 --
