Create a new GitHub repository and Cloud9 Workspace (http://foobt.net/fall2015/csci21_2977/files/setup-github-cloud9.html) named "your_name_final".  DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE BUT ME!

At each moon or planet, you will need to do the following:

- implement code (as required -- described in the game)
- compile your code
- link your code with the CinReader object file and the planet/moon object file
- run the program

The moons/planets you will encounter, in order (assuming you succeed at each stage):

- Titan: link *titan* and *CinReader*
- Saturn: compile your *RocketShip* and link with *saturn*, *CinReader*
- Jupiter: compile your *RocketShip* and link with *jupiter*, *CinReader*
- Mars: compile your *RocketShip*, *SpecialRocketShip*, link with *mars*, *CinReader*
- Earth: compile your *Activator*, link with *earth*, *CinReader*
- Mega Weapon: link *megaweapon*, *CinReader*

WRITE DOWN YOUR KEYS -- YOU WILL SUBMIT YOUR KEYS FOR YOUR GRADE.

Your score on the final challenge will be determined by the number of KEYS you secure:
* SATURN 60%
* JUPITER 70%
* MARS 80%
* EARTH 90%
* BIG RED BUTTON 100%
